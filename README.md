Country Development Status Classification using Unsupervised Learning

This project uses unsupervised machine learning to classify countries as underdeveloped, developing, or developed based on socio-economic and health indicators. The analysis supports HELP International, an NGO aiming to allocate $10 million in aid to the countries most in need.

🚀 Project Overview

Using metrics like GDP, literacy rate, life expectancy, and population factors, the project identifies natural groupings in an unlabelled dataset to help guide strategic funding decisions.

🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyzed distributions, correlations, and missing values
Standardized and prepared data for clustering
🤖 Machine Learning Approach

Applied K-Means Clustering
Used the Silhouette Visualizer to find the optimal cluster count
Labeled clusters into three development categories
📊 Visualizations

🌍 Choropleth Map to show global cluster distribution 📦 Box Plots to compare development indicators These insights support identifying countries needing urgent aid.
